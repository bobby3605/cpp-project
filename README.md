Works for test 1,2,5. 3 and 4 are relatively in order, but when the robot reaches a blank after what has been sorted,
it places the blocks even if it's out of order. Maybe make the robot start at the beginning and check every block when it places all of them?
Or check the block before and see if it's in order, if not, recursively shift all the blocks back in order.
